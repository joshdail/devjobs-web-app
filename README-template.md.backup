## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

I had quite a bit of difficulty trying to set up Vite using npm. Even following the instructions step by step, the project would not run. I was able to set up the project without hassle using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead. Quite a few times I have tried setting up a framework with npm, following the exact step-by-step instructions, but the project will not run.

One of the challenging aspects of this project was the custom list item markers. After trying to work with the li::marker attribute, I ended up finding it better to just get rid of the marker altogether and use custom pseudo-classes instead:

```
ol,
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
  list-style-position: outside;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 0.5rem;
}

ol {
  counter-reset: count;
}

li {
  position: relative;
}

li::before {
  color: var(--clr-violet);
  font-weight: var(--fw-bold);
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
}

ul li::before {
  content: "\2022";
}

ol li {
  counter-increment: count;
}

ol li::before {
  content: counter(count) "";
}

li {
  padding-left: 2.75rem;
}
```


### Continued development

One future goal is developing a better system for organizing styles and stylesheets. Also, continuing to improve my understanding of React.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Documentation on matchMedia](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia) - This was useful for checking prefers-color-scheme in my JS Code. The toggle and the initial state for the display mode are set to light or dark based on whether a preference for dark mode is specified by the system
